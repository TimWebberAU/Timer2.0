Welcome!

This marks the beginning for me in building a coding portfolio for recruiters.

The first (official) project, a timer, which I can use for timeboxing and being productive. 
It's version 2.0 because I built a very basic command-line version with limited functionality.
This will be a GUI version with more advanced features. 


OBJECTIVES:
-> Core use cases
-> Requirements
-> Volatility-based decomposition
-> Component validation
-> Build


CORE USE CASES:
- Accurate countdown timer
- Ability to set the time to any reasonable value
- Ability to pause/play the timer
- Ability to stop/reset the timer


REQUIREMENTS:
- Simple design, easy to use
- Small design, able to sit on a desktop, discreetly in one corner
