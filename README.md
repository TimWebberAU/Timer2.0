Welcome!

This marks the beginning for me in building a coding portfolio for recruiters.

The first (official) project, a timer, which I can use for timeboxing and being productive. 
It's version 2.0 because I built a very basic command-line version with limited functionality.
This will be a GUI version with more advanced features. 


OBJECTIVES:
- Core use cases
- Requirements
- Volatility-based decomposition
- Component UML
- Build


CORE USE CASES:
- Accurate countdown timer
- Ability to set the time to any reasonable value
- Ability to pause/play the timer
- Ability to stop/reset the timer


REQUIREMENTS:
- Simple design, easy to use
- Small design, able to sit on a desktop, discreetly in one corner
- Useable on any system as an app?


VOLATILITIES:
- The menu: The style or elements may be changed at any time for any reason
- The background: An ability to change the background might be nice
- User input: Will need to be controlled and exceptions allowed for
- Clients host machine: Will this app be used on multiple operating systems?
- The GUI method used
- The way the timer is displayed
